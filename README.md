# Password-Strength-Analyzer-
Password Strength Analyzer is a Python-based cybersecurity tool that evaluates password security using multiple checks such as length, character types, pattern detection, and reuse detection. It provides strength scores, improvement suggestions, generates strong passwords, and saves security reports for learning purposes.

## 📌 Project Description
The **Password Strength Analyzer** is a Python-based cybersecurity project designed for beginners. It evaluates password strength using multiple security checks such as length, character diversity, pattern detection, password reuse detection, and dictionary word analysis. The tool also generates strong passwords and saves detailed security reports.

This project demonstrates real-world **password security principles** and **secure coding practices**.
